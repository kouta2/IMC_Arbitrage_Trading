# IMC_Arbitrage_Trading

This is an implementation of an arbitrage trading algorithm that trades between the TACO, BEEF, and TORT markets.
The code is written in Java 8 and is contained in the src/main/java/com/imc/intern/trading folder.

The code needs to be run with a server exchange that I do not have the code for.
